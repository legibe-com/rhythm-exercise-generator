It presents a four-beat measure and randomly displays left/right hands and feet to clap on each beat/upbeat, challenging your independence. Regular practice can lead to a stronger sense of timing and greater ability and confidence in playing an instrument or dancing to music. It is recommended to practice the exercises with a metronome, starting with a tempo of 50bpm, gradually increasing it by 15bpm after you can play the pattern for two minutes straight without error. If you can reach a tempo of around 120-140bpm, then you're all good, and can try another pattern, and increasing the difficulty once you feel more comfortable to.
